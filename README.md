# tasks-express-simple
The tasks practice for express 

## Create an api server providing the following endpoints
  1. GET /tasks       get all tasks (allow query params for filtering)
  2. GET /tasks/:id   get task by id
  3. PUT /tasks/:id   update task by id
  4. POST /tasks      create a new task
  5. DELETE  /tasks/:id  delete task by id
 
## Add some headers in your server to solve the CORS issue
